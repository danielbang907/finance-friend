## Introduction
The problem at hand: young adults/teenagers are becoming increasingly financially illiterate. Jumping straight into “financially sophisticated” websites/applications can be quite daunting - our product aims to make financial concepts and resources more accessible to the average person.

## Interviews & Observations
There are several sites, like Investopedia, that provide definitions of financial concepts. However, these are always individual (i.e, when someone googles “liquidity”) versus being in context and associated with related terms. Sites like crypton.trading show the interactivity and visualization we aimed for. We Demo-ed “https://crypton.trading/” to four different users and asked for questions and observations about the website. We used these responses to guide our prototype.

Our main takeaways from these observations were: (1) visual appeal is very important, (2) font size, color scheme is more noticeable than you think, and (3) the profuct should have a “return” appeal, and not just be a one-and-done website.

## User Tasks
Using our observations, we determined three main tasks the user could perform for the project:
(1) Learn about basic finance terms
(2) Find out what makes a stock lucrative
(3) Create an account and track progress
