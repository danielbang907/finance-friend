                    Someone may place an order to buy Apple at $500, but with the stock trading at $507 that order will not be filled until the price is ≤500. This may be in a few minutes, or may never happen (if Apple continues to rise).

                    You may wonder, “what if I think a company is going to become unprofitable or lose value?” In this situation, it’s possible to <span class="simple-tooltip" title="Short selling is the act of borrowing someone's stock and selling instantly, promising to pay them back at a later date.

If you believed Apple would go down from $500 to $250, and shorted it at $500, you can cover your short at $250, meaning you made $250 since you sold at $500 and only need to buy it for $250 to pay back the person who lent it to you. If it never goes below $500, you will have lost money because you must repay it at a higher price.
